Objective

The objective of this assignment is to:

Apply a roll-number-based nonlinear transformation to a dataset feature.
Learn the parameters of a probability density function (PDF) for the transformed variable.
Estimate Gaussian distribution parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
Dataset

Dataset Used: India Air Quality Data
Feature Considered: NO2

The dataset contains air quality measurements across various locations in India. For this assignment, only the NO2 column is used as the feature variable x.

Step 1: Non-Linear Transformation

Each value of x is transformed into a new variable z using:

z = x + a_r * sin(b_r * x)

Where: a_r = 0.05 * (r mod 7) b_r = 0.3 * (r mod 5 + 1) r = 102303463

For roll number 102303463: r mod 7 = 3 r mod 5 = 3

Therefore: a_r = 0.15 b_r = 1.2

Final transformation: z = x + 0.15 * sin(1.2x)

Step 2: Learning the Probability Density Function

The transformed variable z is modeled using the Gaussian probability density function:

p(z) = c * exp(-lambda * (z - mu)^2)

Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation:

mu = mean(z) sigma^2 = variance(z)

lambda = 1 / (2 * sigma^2) c = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi * sigma^2)

Estimated Parameters

lambda = 0.0014599899081690277 mu = 25.80638519611327 c = 0.021557579212396885

Conclusion

The NO2 feature was transformed using a roll-number-based nonlinear function. A Gaussian distribution was fitted to the transformed variable using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The estimated parameters define the learned probability density function for the transformed data.
